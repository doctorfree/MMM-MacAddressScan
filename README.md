# MMM-MacAddressScan
A module for MagicMirror which determines the status of devices on the
network based on their MAC address. It can also look up devices by
IP addresses or hostnames.

This module is an enhanced fork of the excellent MMM-NetworkScanner
module by Ian Perrin (http://ianperrin.com).

## Technical Overview

The scan of the local area network is performed by the `arp-scan` tool
which uses the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). ARP is a communication
protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address,
associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.
This mapping is a critical function in the Internet protocol suite. ARP was
defined in 1982 by RFC 826, which is Internet Standard STD 37.

This module uses ARP packets to discover all active devices in a LAN even if
protected by a firewall designed to hide the presence of the device. Whether
you are using ethernet or WiFi, the IPv4 devices on your LAN must respond to
ARP or they cannot communicate. Since ARP is non-routable, this type of scanner
only works on the local LAN (local subnet or network segment).

Devices cannot hide from ARP packets like they can hide from Ping.

## Installation

In your terminal, install `arp-scan`:
```console
sudo apt-get install arp-scan   
```

*Optionally*, update the vendor database used by `arp-scan`:
```console
cd /usr/share/arp-scan
sudo get-iab -v -u http://standards-oui.ieee.org/iab/iab.txt
sudo get-oui -v -u http://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.txt
```

Clone this repository into the MagicMirror Modules folder:
```console
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
git clone https://gitlab.com/doctorfree/MMM-MacAddressScan.git
```

Install the dependencies (`sudo`, `ping`) in the MMM-MacAddressScan module folder:
```console
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-MacAddressScan
npm install
```

Add the module to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
```javascript
    {
        module: 'MMM-MacAddressScan',
        position: 'top_left', 
        config: {
            // Optional config options
        }        
    },
```

## Configuration

| **Option** | **Default** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `devices` | [] | an array of devices to be found on the network. See [Device object](#device-object) |
| `network` | `-l` | `optional` a network mask to limit the scope of the network scan, i.e. `192.168.0.0/24`. If omitted, or set to `-l`, the entire network will be scanned. |
| `interface` | `` | `optional` the network interface on which to broadcast, useful if arp-scan is not finding devices, for example `wlan0` or `eth1`. leave empty for default |
| `showIP` | true | `optional` shows the IP address of devices found on the network |
| `showUnknown` | true | `optional` shows devices found on the network even if not specified in the `devices` option |
| `showOffline` | true | `optional` shows devices specified in the `devices` option even when offline |
| `showLastSeen` | false | `optional` shows when the device was last seen e.g. "Device Name - last seen 5 minutes ago" |
| `keepAlive` | 180 | `optional` how long (in seconds) a device should be considered 'alive' since it was last found on the network |
| `updateInterval` | 20 | `optional` how often (in seconds) the module should scan the network |
| `sort` | `true` | `optional` sorts the devices in alphabetical order when shown in the mirror |
| `residents` | [] | `optional` an array of names of the devices that should be monitored if they are online |
| `occupiedCMD` | `{}` | `optional` the notification to be sent if one of the devices in the `residents` array is found online. See [Notification Example](#notification-example). |
| `vacantCMD` | `{}` | `optional` the notification to be sent if **NONE** of the devices in the `residents` array is found online. See [Notification Example](#notification-example). |
| `debug` | `false` | `optional` adds extended messages to the log. |
| `colored` | `false` | `optional` determines whether devices are shown in the color defined in the devices section. |
| `coloredSymbolOnly` | `false` | `optional` shows only the devices symbol. |
| `showLastSeenWhenOffline:` | `false` | `optional` show last seen only when offline. |
| `showDeviceColumns:` | `false` | `optional` show devices as columns. |
| `coloredState:` | `false` | `optional` determines whether devices are shown in a color defined in the devices section and controlled by the online / offline state. |


### Device Object
The device object contains information about the devices to be found on the network.

| **Key** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `macAddress` | `optional` the MAC address of the device. | `aa:bb:cc:11:22:33` |
| `ipAddress` | `optional` the IP address **or** host name of the device. | `192.168.0.1` or `gitlab.com` |
| `name` | `optional` the friendly name for the device. If omitted, the `macAddress` or `ipAddress` will be used. | `Phone` or `Router` |
| `icon` | `optional` the symbol to show next to the device. See [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/) cheatsheet. If omitted, `question` will be used. | There are a huge number of icons to choose from. Here are some examples: `globe`, `server`, `desktop`, `laptop`, `mobile`, `wifi`. |
| `color` | `optional` the color the device should be displayed with. | `#0000ff`  for blue |
| `colorStateOnline` | `optional` the color the device should be displayed with when it is online. | `#00ff00`  for green |
| `colorStateOffline` | `optional` the color the device should be displayed with when it is offline. | `#ff0000`  for red |
| `showInNewRow` | `optional` add a line break if showDeviceColumns = true. | false  for no line break |

**Note:** A device object should only contain either a `macAddress` *or*
an `ipAddress` **NOT** both.

**Note:** MAC and Static IP addresses work more consistently than DHCP
assigned addresses or hostnames.

**Note:** The `coloredState` parameter overwrites the `colored` parameter if
both parameters are set to true. With the parameter `coloredSymbolOnly` the
status driven coloring can be limited to the icon. 

#### Generating the device array
The `devices` array can be generated by using `arps2mm.sh` from within the
`scripts` folder. The output of the script will include all the devices
found on the network, using the name of the vendor identified from the
arp-scan result. Run the following script, edit the device names and icons
then copy the array into the config file:

```console
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-MacAddressScan/scripts
chmod +x arps2mm.sh
./arps2mm.sh
```

If a network interface needs to be specified for `arp-scan` to detect devices
on the local network then run `arps2mm.sh` with the `-I <interface>` option.
For example:

```console
./arps2mm.sh -I wlan0
```

**Note:** Updating the vendor database is recommended before generating the
device array. See the [installation instructions](#installation) for details.

### Examples

#### Simple example
Scans the network (using the default `updateInterval`) and display the status
of the four specified devices. Display the IP of discovered devices as well:
```javascript
    {
        module: "MMM-MacAddressScan",
        position: "top_left",
        header: "Who's home",
        config: {
            devices: [
                { macAddress: "1a:1b:1c:1a:1b:1c", name: "Dad", icon: "male"},
                { macAddress: "2a:2b:2c:2a:2b:2c", name: "Mum", icon: "female"},
                { macAddress: "3a:3b:3c:3a:3b:3c", name: "Son", icon: "male"},
                { macAddress: "4a:4b:4c:4a:4b:4c", name: "Daughter", icon: "female"}
            ],
            showIP: true,
            showUnknown: false,
        }
     }
```
#### Example with columns
Displays the specified devices as columns:
```javascript
    {
        module: "MMM-MacAddressScan",
        position: "top_left",
        header: "Ger√§te im Netzwerk",
        config: {
            devices: [
                { 
                    ipAddress: "192.168.178.101", 
                    name: "UniFi", 
                    icon: "server", 
                    colorStateOnline: "green", 
                    colorStateOffline: "red",
                },
                { 
                    ipAddress: "192.168.178.31", 
                    name: "QNAP1", 
                    icon: "database", 
                    colorStateOnline: "green", 
                    colorStateOffline: "red",
                 },
                { 
                    ipAddress: "192.168.178.32", 
                    name: "QNAP2", 
                    icon: "database", 
                    colorStateOnline: "green", 
                    colorStateOffline: "red",
                    showInNewRow: true,
                },
                { 
                    ipAddress: "192.168.178.33", 
                    name: "QNAP3", 
                    icon: "database", 
                    colorStateOnline: "green", 
                    colorStateOffline: "red",
                },
                { 
                    ipAddress: "192.168.178.134", 
                    name: "APS", 
                    icon: "wifi", 
                    colorStateOnline: "green", 
                    colorStateOffline: "red",
                 },

            ],
            sort: false,
            showIP: false,
            showUnknown: false,
            showDeviceColumns: true,
            coloredState: true,
        }
    }
```
#### Keep alive example
Scan every 5 seconds and only display the specified devices whether they are
online or offline. Devices will continue to be shown as online
(i.e. kept alive) for 5 mins after they are last found:
```javascript
    {
        module: 'MMM-MacAddressScan',
        position: 'top_left', 
        config: {
            devices: [
                    { ipAddress: "gitlab.com", name: "Gitlab", icon: "globe"},
                    { macAddress: "1a:1b:1c:1a:1b:1c", name: "Server", icon: "server"},
                    { macAddress: "2a:2b:2c:2a:2b:2c", name: "Desktop", icon: "desktop"},
                    { ipAddress: "10.1.1.10", name: "Laptop", icon: "laptop"},
                    { macAddress: "4a:4b:4c:4a:4b:4c", name: "Mobile", icon: "mobile"},
                ],
            showIP: false,
            showUnknown: false,
            showOffline: true,
            keepAlive: 300,
            updateInterval: 5
        }        
    },
```

#### Notification example
As with the previous example, this scans every 5 seconds and only display
the specified devices whether they are online or offline. Devices will
continue to be shown as online (i.e. kept alive) for 5 mins after they
are last found on the network.

In addition, the module will send a notification (`occupiedCMD`) to turn
the monitor on when either `Mobile` or `Laptop` (the `residents`) are found
on the network. Another notification (`vacantCMD`) will be sent when neither
device is online:
```javascript
    {
        module: 'MMM-MacAddressScan',
        position: 'top_left', 
        config: {
            devices: [
                    { ipAddress: "gitlab.com", name: "Gitlab", icon: "globe"},
                    { macAddress: "1a:1b:1c:1a:1b:1c", name: "Server", icon: "server"},
                    { macAddress: "2a:2b:2c:2a:2b:2c", name: "Desktop", icon: "desktop"},
                    { ipAddress: "10.1.1.10", name: "Laptop", icon: "laptop"},
                    { macAddress: "4a:4b:4c:4a:4b:4c", name: "Mobile", icon: "mobile"},
                ],
            showUnknown: false,
            showOffline: true,
            keepAlive: 300,
            updateInterval: 5,
            residents: ["Mobile", "Laptop"],
            occupiedCMD: {notification: 'REMOTE_ACTION', payload: {action: 'MONITORON'}},
            vacantCMD  : {notification: 'REMOTE_ACTION', payload: {action: 'MONITOROFF'}},

        }        
    },
```
**NOTE** The `REMOTE_ACTION` notifications (`MONITORON` and `MONITOROFF`) actions
require the [MMM-Remote-Control](https://github.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control)
module to be installed.

## CSS Styling

The default styling applied to the MMM-MacAddressScan module is as follows:

```css
.MMM-MacAddressScan .deviceCell {
  text-align: left;
}

.MMM-MacAddressScan .deviceCell i {
  padding-left: 0;
  padding-right: 10px;
}

.MMM-MacAddressScan .dateCell {
  padding-left: 30px;
  text-align: right;
}
```

Additional custom styling may be applied with entries in:

```console
MagicMirror/css/custom.css
```

For example, to increase the font size of devices text labels
and module header, add the following to your custom.css file:

```css
.MMM-MacAddressScan .module-header {
  font-size: 28px;
  color: #B5F5F2;
}

.MMM-MacAddressScan .deviceCell {
  font-size: 28px;
}

.MMM-MacAddressScan .headerDevCell {
  font-size: 28px;
}
```

## TelegramBot integration
You can dynamically control some MMM-MacAddressScan configuration settings
using the Telegram app by installing the
[MMM-TelegramBot](https://github.com/bugsounet/MMM-TelegramBot)
module and adding MMM-TelegramBot configuration to your `config.js`.

### TelegramBot installation
Follow the instructions at the
[4th Party Modules Wiki](http://wiki.bugsounet.fr/en/MMM-TelegramBot)
to create a Telegram Bot, install MMM-TelegramBot, and configure your
MagicMirror `config.js` to enable Telegram commands.

**Note:** You do not need to create custom commands. The Telegram commands
used with MMM-MacAddressScan are already created by the module. You only need
to follow the [4th Party Modules Wiki Installation instructions](http://wiki.bugsounet.fr/en/MMM-TelegramBot/Installation).

### Telegram usage
Once installed and configured, you can control your MMM-MacAddressScan display
by sending messages in the Telegram app to your previously created Telegram Bot.
The supported commands are:

- /showip
- /hideip
- /showOffline
- /hideOffline
- /updateInterval &lt;seconds&gt;
- /getconfig

The commands `/showip` and `/hideip` show and hide, respectively, the IP
addresses of discovered devices.

The commands `/showOffline` and `/hideOffline` show and hide, respectively,
offline discovered devices.

The command `/updateInterval <seconds>` sets the interval betweeen device
scans in seconds. The 'seconds' argument must be a non-negative integer and
represents the number of seconds between device scans.

The command `getconfig` displays the current settings for the `showIP`,
`showOffline`, and `updateInterval` configuration parameters.

## Update

To update the module to the latest version, use your terminal to go to your
MMM-MacAddressScan module folder and type the following command:

```console
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-MacAddressScan
git pull
npm install
``` 

If you haven't changed the module then this should work without problem. 
Type `git status` to see your changes. If there are any changes, you can
reset them with `git reset --hard`. After that, `git pull` should be possible.
